<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

This project performs the imputation of missing values on the life expectancy dataset using the application of linear regression, kNN regression, and MLP regression models in Python with scikit-learn package.   


<!-- DATA DESCRIPTION -->
## Data Description

The dataset is obtained from the website https://www.kaggle.com/kumarajarshi/life-expectancy-who/version/1


There are 20 variables in the dataset which was collected for 193 countries during 16 years from 2000 to 2015. Among those, variables regarding health and life expectancy were collected from the WHO website, while the ecomonic variables were from the United Nation website.

Below are the list of all variables:

1. Life expectancy:           _Average life expectancy (age) for a country in a particular year_
2. Year
3. Status:                    _The status of country (Developed or Developing)_ 
4. Adult Mortality:           _Probability of dying between 15 and 60 years per 1000 population_
5. Infant deaths:             _Number of Infant Deaths per 1000 population_
6. Alcohol:                   _Alcohol, recorded per capita (15+) consumption (in litres)_
7. Percentage Expenditure:    _Expenditure on health as a percentage of Gross Domestic Product per capita(%)_
8. Hepatitis B:               _Hepatitis B immunization coverage among 1-year-olds (%)_
9. Measles:                   _Measles - number of reported cases per 1000 population_
10. BMI:                      _Average Body Mass Index of entire population_
11. Under-five deaths:        _Number of under-five deaths per 1000 population_
12. Polio:                    _Polio immunization coverage among 1-year-olds (%)_
13. Total expenditure:        _Government expenditure on health as a percentage of total government expenditure (%)_
14. Diphtheria:               _Diphtheria tetanus toxoid and pertussis immunization coverage among 1-year-olds_
15. HIV/AIDS:                 _Deaths per 1000 live births HIV/AIDS (0-4 years)_
16. GDP:                      _Gross Domestic Product per capita (in USD)_
17. Population:               _Population of the country_
18. Thinness 10-19 years:     _Prevalence of thinness among children and adolescents for Age 10-19_ 
19. Thinness 5-9 year:        _Prevalence of thinness among children for Age 5-9_
20. Income composition:       _Human Development Index in terms of income of resources composition (from 0 to 1)_
21. Schooling:                _Number of years of Schooling_

Life expectancy is the response variable, and the rest are the predictors.
